## नमस्ते राही

I am Atharva Amritkar, a 4th yr undergraduate student in IIT Kharagpur. I am from Pune

Professionally, I have done various open source programs like GSoC, Summer of Bitcoin during my sophomore year and while doing these programs I found my interests in decentralised finance, crypto economics and blockchain in general. So during my third yr I did several Defi and web3 based internships, and also was called by government of Canada for a research internship in the field of blockchain, where I worked on integrating zk proofs and blockchain with hospitals and worked on crypto economics there. Also I worked with polygon technology where I was. a strategic growth consultant, then I worked with Aten ventures where I was a venture capital analyst intern and was a part of investment analyst team there
With my entrepreneurial spirit I founded Zkare, which I pitched to vitalik buterin founder of ethereum protocol during Ethwaterloo and also received grants there. 

Apart from this, I have been actively involved in multiple positions of responsibilities and extra curricular activities here at IIT Kharagpur.
I have been a part of Koss since 4 yrs where I am an advisor now. Also founded blockchain society in IIT KGP where we teach students about decentralised finance, web3 and crypto economics.
