## Introducing Ocean

This research report presents the Ocean Protocol. Ocean is a decentralized protocol and network of artificial intelligence (AI) data/services. It aims to spread the benefits of AI, by unlocking data while preserving privacy. It helps power marketplaces to buy/sell AI data & services, software to publish and access commons data, and AI/data science tools to consume data. Ocean does decentralized orchestration: at its core are decentralized service agreements and decentralized access control, which execute on decentralized virtual machines. This allows connection to, monetization of, and curation of arbitrary data services. On that, Ocean adds network rewards to incentivize data sharing, including privacy-preserving data commons.

## Whitepaper Review


Ocean does decentralized orchestration: at its core are decentralized service agreements and decentralized access control, which execute on decentralized virtual machines. This allows connection to, monetization of, and curation of arbitrary data services. On that, Ocean adds network rewards to incentivize data sharing, including privacy-preserving data commons.


Trustful Data Sharing – We bring together decentralized technology, a trust framework, and an ecosystem for data and related services. This allows for data to be shared while guaranteeing traceability, transparency, and privacy to enable data owners to maintain control of their data assets and access a wide range of marketplaces and services.


A Tokenized Service Layer – The Ocean protocol provides a tokenized service layer that offers data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks.

1001 Marketplaces – Any data marketplace can hook into Ocean to provide “last mile” services, connecting data providers and consumers. The Ocean protocol is designed so that data owners control each dataset and cannot be locked into any single marketplace.


The Mission to Unlock Data – Society is becoming increasingly reliant on data, especially with the advent of AI. However, a small handful of organizations with both massive data assets and AI capabilities attained worrying levels of control which is a danger to a free and open society.
“We aim to unlock data, for more equitable outcomes for users of data, using a thoughtful application of both technology and governance. Our team and community is committed to kick-starting a New Data Economy that reaches every single person, company and device, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our world.”


Ocean’s Networks reward schedule uses Bitcoin’s schedule as a starting point, including half-life of four years. However it has a “ratchet-up” phase in the beginning to give time to OceanDAO to stabilize.


We now provide precise equations describing the Ocean Network Rewards schedule. g(t) is the overall schedule. It’s a piecewise model of four exponential curves.
